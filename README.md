14/07
Hotfix for "return" functionality applied (changes in APIsecure.js and bookController.js)

14/07
Sorry didn't 
1. ISSUE/RETURN/UPVOTING done. <-- Nice
2. Regression part needed at returning part (but I'm pretty confident).
3. **CSS**. Make this a priority. It's high time dude.
4. Yea, first some CSS shit, then you got to clean up some front-end mess too. (I know you'll do it with point 3 though).


06/07: *Wow. It's been a month already.*
1. Upvoting isn't done yet. so many issues saving the data. check for NaN in points' value
2. Changed frontend contract for toggleUpvote, only book id required in request, not the whole object.


05-06:
1. Dynamic link is **GREEN**, but no handling is there yet.
2. Points 2,3,4 are still remaining.
<eom>


04-06:

Upvote is Green now! Yellow actually.
**TODO**--> 
 1. Dynamic links for books.
 2. Proper Contract b/w front-back end.
 3. Implementing that upvote thing.
 4. Issuing the book.


02-06: 

1. JWT Verification is a go now!!!
2. mapping b/w books and users is now more clear.
3. TODO>:>>> change in model: upvoted_by_user
4. also, check if separate upvoted by and downvoted by are required or simple books he voted structure is good **ANALYSIS REQUIRED**.
